# Labview Video and Data Synchronization and Collection Interface
 A Labview program for synchronizing externally triggered camera video and Labview DAQ data, with an intuitive interface.

Data is only as good as the foundation on which it is collected. As you increase the number of devices using separate hardware, accurate timing between them becomes more difficult. Even when you have a solution that meets these needs, the interface with your tools can be annoying to deal with.
This program aims to alleviate some of that pain by providing a (mostly) intuitive interface for collecting triggered data and synchronizing it with data measured from a DAQ, as well as synchronized signal generation. However, even if no camera is being used, the ability to reconfigure the data collection view and easy to manage real time plots should prove useful.

The main panel appears as such:
